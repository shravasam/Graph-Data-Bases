# Neo4j-Cypher-Py2Neo

When i was first used Neo4j in 2017 there no so much of stuff integrated int Neo4j. But now it seems preety cool compared to other graph databases.

Here i am going to develop scripts using python py2neo library in Neo4j graph data base and cypher is similar like plsql script but its different.

i want to explore more graph databases including cloud and desktop applications.
